        I leave for Naples today! I'm sitting in a cafe right now, killig time until my 5pm flight. I guess it's not killing time, because I am
        really enjoying working on this website actually. Plus I did the crossword. I am going to be doing a work exchange at a hostel in Naples
        for 6 weeks (hopefully). I'm really nervous but I also think that it's such an awesome opportunity that I can't say no to. I decided to 
        do this like 2 days ago. This is good because I'll be saving a ton of money. 
        <br><br>
        I spent the last 2 weeks in the UK and I thought that it was a lovely experience! London is great, I understand why Taylor Swift liked it 
        so much. I also don't know why people (my PI) was hyping up to me how much a culture shock it would be. Everyone is really nice (a girl
        complimented my hair on the street yesterday) and the weather isn't even that bad (although I've been told that I came at a really 
        advantageous time). Edinburgh was also lovely, but the guy I talked to in the Glasgow phone store was right, there's way too many tourists.
        I don't mind acting like a tourist when I am one, but it was more a complaint about the sheer number of people that were there. Either way,
        I can't wait to finally spend time on an actual beach. 
        <br><br>
        Anyways, despite how yappy I feel right now, I don't want to write too much for the first entry because that's setting the bar too high 
        for the content I will be expecting out of myself.
