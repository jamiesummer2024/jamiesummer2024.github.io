        <h2>July 30</h2>
        <div>
            <p>
                It has been a while since I last updated. I left for Germany on the 16th, and came back the 23rd, then I just kind have been so busy since being back. There is so much to update, and I will try my best to cover everything since I've been really slacking. I guess I will start with the facts of my life and then go onto my ruminations.
                <br><br>
                Heidelberg was amazing. Hermann and Lawrence have this amazing home in a beautiful neighbourhood. They have 2 terraces and lots of green space, and such a strong community. They live in Rohrbach which is technically a suburb of Heidelberg, but its literally a 20 minute bike ride from the city centre,so it has small town vibes while still being super convenient for everything. It's less than 5 minutes walk away from 3 supermarkets and a 5 minute walk from their regional train station. Basically, it's where I wanna live when I grow up. Hermann is retired, and his thing is like really stupid and provocative tank tops, which Lawrence hates. I also met Hermann's ex wife Karin, who took me kayaking. She still texts me, like yesterday she sent me a photo of Hermann doing the 2013 Heidelberg triathlon, which I thought was funny. She also texts me in German, so I have to Google Translate everything she sends me. While in Germany, I also visited Anj (hi Anj) in Erfurt, which was an amazing time, because I think I hadn't realized how long it had been since I saw a familiar face from home. It was so nice to just be able to speak and be completely understood. My favourite day in Heidelberg was when Hermann took me to Schwetzingen Palace (so I guess not technically in Heidelberg), which had this massive garden based off of Versailles, and I feel like I could just walk there for hours. Hermann told me that people often have sex in the bushes there. Karin and Hermann also collect art, and since their last names are Middendorf (I guess Karin kept her name), there is this artist named Helmut Middendorf who is apparetly really famous, and they thought it would be funny if they were able to own a Middendorf, but it's really expensive. So they bought these prints of Middendorf works and they have matching ones hanging in their respective houses. The day I went kayaking with Karin, she showed me her art collection, and invited me to her house for Schnapps, but then I had to bike home drunk from her house at like 2am and I think on my way home I saw Nazis. Like they were white and bald and had these matching leather jackets and were standing in a group. Lawrence was very impressed that I got home. Karin texted me after and said that she was "charmed by my interesting personality". So from Heidelberg, you have to fly in through either Stuttgart or Frankfurt, but I used Stuttgart since it has a Eurowings base. Apparently Lawrence told me that Eurowings is one of the worst airlines in Europe, and I totally agree. Both flights I took with them were like 2 hours delayed. Not only that, I am a Deutsch Bahn victim. My ICE train from Bruchsal to Stuttgart got cancelled, so I had to take the regional train to Karlruhe and the take an ICE from there, meaning that I showed up at the airport an hour late, and like 20 minutes before the gates closed. But luckily, it is Eurowing, so my flight was delayed. Perhaps I'm just having bad plane luck this summer. I seriously considered not flying back to Naples. I just had such a good time in Germany. I also found out crazy family lore from Lawrence, which I guess is like uncle tea. I have so much more to say about my Germany saga, but I feel like I have so much to talk about and I just need to get everything down. 
                <br><br>
                Coming back to the hostel, I felt instantly worse. I think it was also because the Americans left, so there really was a sense of joy that dissappeared. Also Gerry was sick the day I came back and a few days after so we was in a properly foul mood. He was very snappy with me for a couple days, but I think where I snapped was this: There was a group of 5 people that booked a full 7 person room, because they wanted to have an entire room for themselves. This is fine I guess, but they were very young, like barely 18 and it was the girl that checked in's boyfriend's mom that made the booking. At the hostel, the dorm rooms don't lock, but the floor locks, and each floor has 2-3 rooms. Plus, if a guest has a privacy concern, we can usually put them in a 2 bed private room that does lock. The group didn't like that the rooms themselves didn't lock, and they told me at like 11:45pm that they were leaving, like they booked another accommodation. I was like, we have a 48 hour cancellation policy, you can't just do this, you have to pay (we usually let people pay before checking out instead of upon checkin, my personal opinion on this weird policy is irrelevant). And they were like, you have our card on file, please deal with this through email with the boyfriend's mom. And it's not like I can physically stop them from walking out the door, so I was like okay I guess, and I texted Gerry asking whether I should charge the 2 nights for 7 people, which is a lot of money for having not stayed here at all, so I wasn't sure whether he would wanna go easy on them. He told me to charge them for 1 night, and the the card payment didn't go through, like it said transaction failed. My shift ends at midnight, so I didn't think much of it and went to bed. Like in my mind, when you own a business like this, you know that you'll be losing some money. Like when you own a restaurant, you just know some people are gonna dine and dash, and it's not like the waiter's fault or anything. The next day, Gerry comes in and is like "why didn't you call me". And I know that he was just sick and upset that he lost out on a lot of money, and wanted someone to blame. And I was like dude, I texted you immediately, if you wanted you could've called ME. And he was like no you should've called me as soon as it happened, and I was like they were literally like out the door, it woudln't have made a difference. He didn't train me to charge cards, I didn't know that they could not go through, I didn't think that it was a big deal that they didn't pay upfront if we had their card on file. And he started raising his voice at me, like you should've called me, why would you not call me. And I actually apologised to him, like he is the owner, and if he had an expectation that I didn't meet I'll apologize. So I was like, I'm sorry for not calling you, I know to do it next time, I didn't know whether it was an appropriate time to call you. And then he said "oh yeah, the when would you consider an appropriate time?" in a raised voice, and I literally walked away. Like I already apologized, and I suppose now he is accusing something about my character? Which I won't tolerate. Gabi was there when it happened, and she actually defended me once I walked away which I thought was really sweet of her. She was explaining how it was really late and all of that, because he never yells at Gabi. After that I was going to leave. He came back later that day and yelled at me again for just like random shit, like why didn't you clean this and that etc... I think I really struggled when that happened because I had nobody to talk to about it. I was like literally searching up flights home. 
                <br><br>
                That night, I went out with some of the guests, and there was this guy from Montreal that I ended up talkig to all night. Immediately, I sensed an extreme ease in commuication, probably because he was Canadian and he was a physics teacher, who did his Master's in something about analytically finding the solutions to solar flares using the Navier-Stokes equations. Like he was an extremely easy person to talk to because we shared so much life context. When it got to like 3am, we ended up sharing a cigarette in the street outside of the hostel (I started smoking in Europe y'all, it's so hard not to :/) and we chatted about family stuff and grad school stuff. And then he asked whether I liked working at the hostel. And I was like oh, I like how Naples is close to all these places, and I love the other workers, and whatever. And he was like, any negatives? And I was like ummmmmm, and I said something about work being stressful sometimes. And he was like "you're sure it's not about the owner?". I was like how did you know? And he had apparently spoken to Gerry before and caught a vibe, like he had been staying at the hostel for like 4 nights, but I had just gotten back the night before so I never chatted with him. And so I ended up telling him about all of Gerry's shit, about him being racist and misogynistic, and how he yelled at me earlier that day. It was extremely validating. Like just having someone stand in front of me and tell me I'm not crazy for what I think. Like this guy definitely has sisters or something, because it is rare to see someone listen with that degree of empathy. I asked him whether I should leave. He said that I have every reason to leave, but the way that I'm thinking about the situation is completely correct, so whatever I decide to do will be the right thing to do. Which I know is a non-answer, but I think in that moment, I really needed someone to tell me that I was thinkig about the situation in a correct way. He just understood what I meant by everything. Like I told him that I struggle talking about it with the other girrls, because for example Gabi is really young, and he was like "yeah, so when he criticizes her, she puts it onto herself, right?", which was spot on. He just got everything immediately, and I felt like I didn't have to justify myself once. I remember when I was done talking, I was like "sorry for yapping, I know I was just ranting there" and he was like "no, thank you for being so vulnerable". I never found out his name. I'm sure he told me, but I don't know his name, and I could easily check from reception, but I didn't want to. I like to think that he was sent to me in my most troubled times to talk to me and ease the burden. He checked out the next day, so I never saw him again. Maybe if I didn't have that conversation I would've gone home.
                <br><br>
                The next morning I saw Nicole (hi nicole!) and I switched shifts with Dylan so I could wake up early and meet with her. As I was leaving, I bumped into Gerry outside, and he just talked to me like it was normal, like "hey jamie! where are you going so early". I was like oh I'm meetig a friend. What a great chat me and Nicole had, just nonstop yapping for 2 hours straight, before she had to go to Rome. So much burden lifted from me. Then, I went to the beach in Sorrento with Gabi. There are so many things to admire about Gabi. She was clearly raised extremely well, and she has the purest heart of anyone I know. She has this deep sense of self-worth that is instilled in her in a way that only a parent can. Because of that, she's also not afraid to ask for what she wants, for example, she always asks us to walk slower when were in a group, because she hates walking fast because it makes her sweat. However, this is the first job that she's ever had, meaning she doesn't understad that a lot of this is NOT NORMAL. She just accepts everything, which makes it really hard to talk to her about the struggles. Conversely, I think me and Laurence worked it out on the remix. Laurence just got back from a trip to Germany, where she was visiting a boy that she was seeing at the end of her school year. She was feeling really badly after she got back, because she wasn't sure whether she was going to see him again, and she didn't have closure on the relationship, since he lived in Germany, and she lives in Quebec City. Gabi had a break for 3 days, so we went out for coffee and Aperols just the two of us to talk about it, and while we were there, I talked to her about Gerry's racism and why it bothers me so much. I feel like we are on the same page about it, and she said, as I suspected, that she definitely notices it, but she also hates Naples and the hostel, so she just gets through every interaction with him. She can't wait to leave. I think that I don't agree with her actions, but I forgive her. Especially since she gave me the space to hear me out, and interact with what I say. I also struggle to judge someone else's coping mechanism since she is also feeling lousy. She also acknowledged that she didn't try hard enough to make me feel welcome at the beginning because I arrived at the same time that a lot of the people that she was very close to were leaving, and she was also thinkig a lot about her German boy. She told me that I arrived at the worst time, because the vibe completely changed right before I arrrived. Becuase right before me was Greta, and Greta did not work ever, and Gerry let her becuase he liked her. So the status quo right before I showed up was to do no work. And now he's yellig at people for doing no work, when the people who did no work were the ones training us, because Gerry likes little girls. 
                <br><br>
                Since that incident, I decided that I would remove any personal relatioship I could possibly have with Gerry, to the extent that I will only talk to him about things related to the work. If he asks how my day is, I will answer him "good" and that's it. I will avoid him when I'm not working. When I'm working, I will do my work 100%, because he is the owner. But I will not talk to him. He doesn't deserve a personal relationship with me. And he can't pick and choose when he wants to be my friend. When he comes to talk to me at the desk about something not related to work, I just excuse myself to go to the bathroom or something. If he comes into the room when I'm not working, I leave. I don't let him find faults in my work, because I try my hardest. And it's honestly given me such peace of mind. Like my mood has gotten so much better since the incident, becuase of my avoidment strategy, and also becuase I have Laurence as a confidant. I'm doing okay right now, I hope it stays this way until August 10th, which is my last day. Less than 2 weeks to go! Honestly, upon reflection, my experience here could even be described as positive, if I ignore Gerry. That's why he annoys me so much I think. This experience could actually be like incredible if it weren't for this one man. Who has managed to ruin everything by being the worst person in the entire world. I met one of the other owners, Jeremie, yesterday, and I think we really bonded. He is this French guy, who apparently works as a magician's agent and videographer. He has a documentary coming out in October about clay houses in Western Europe called Touché Terre. Gerry talks so much shit about Jeremie, but I actually love Jeremie. He's this really artistic guy, and I think that I really love those kinds of people. I think Jeremie understands me, and I'm gonna ask him to send me a copy of his documentary before he leaves. 
                <br><br>
                So Dylan is unfortunately like very silly. He is also the sweetest person and he's a really great cook and he gets along really well with the guests, he's one of those people that are always in a good mood. But he's really bad at reception, becuase he'll just forget to do random things and doesn't understand some stuff. Like he got blackmailed the other day, because he was on a "sexy facetime call" with a girl, and she took photos and threatened to blackmail him with them. And he woke up Blanca at 2am (sorry I totally forgot to mention Blanca, she is a new worker and my new roommate, she is from Spain and Dylan uses her to translate a lot because her English is really good, which pisses her off sometimes, but she's super chill and very sweet) to go with him to the police station. And she was like no.... Like what are the Italian police going to do about this? Also, he SHOWED GERRY THE VIDEO because he was tryinng to get advice from Gerry and Gerry was like wtf??? like don't show me this???? And apparently the blackmailer threatened to send it to Aby and Taylor, like he mentioned them by name and their @s so Dylan talked to me and Gabi and was like yeah I'm sorry if you get a message from the blackmailer. And I was like no Dylan it's okay, I won't open it, and he was like "well you can open it if you want". And I was like wtf Dylan. Dylan literally told the Montreal guy, who then told me, that he pretends his English isn't as good around Gerry so he can't get mad at him. And it's really sad that he has to do that. But for some reason he acts like he's bros with Gerry, but I think he just kind of annoys Gerry.
                <br><br>
                I have been compiling a list of fucked up things Gerry has said, in order for you all to get a full picture of the kind of person he is, and to truly impress upon you all why I avoid speaking to him about anythig personal: 
                <br>
                - So Gabi's initials are GG, and her last name is super long and very complicated because it's Lithuanian. So she was talking to Gerry about how she goes by Gigi at home like GG, and he, without skipping a beat, was like "oh like your cup size". Because Gabi has really big boobs. But like oh my god. And not only that, he and Agostino were like joking about it together while Clara was in the same room??? Like Clara, Agostino's girlfriend. 
                <br>
                - Dylan is a big guy, like I wouldn't call him fat but he like clearly just lifts a lot, so he has trouble with cardio, like he sweats a lot when he does a lot of the housekeeping tasks, also because Naples is 36 deg. But Gerry makes fat jokes about him all the time! Like Dylan will be slightly out of breath and Gerry will be like "what happened to you, did you walk up one flight of stairs?" and when Dylan told Gerry about the blackmail, Gerry was like "really you? fat guy?" and it's so uncalled for, because he clearly just thinks that he can be mean to Dylan because he doesn't understand him. Or like can't defend himself. Also one time Dylan asked Gerry if he could come back to work in the fall, and Gerry was like "yeah as long as you don't rape anyone" and Dylan was like what? Because I suppose he doesn't know that word in English. And Gerry had to like explain to him what it was and I was like what am I listening to. Like what kind of joke is that?
                <br>
                - Gabi told me that Gerry talks shit about me, like Dylan started this small business where he charges guests 5 euros for dinner that he cooks, and it's always good. And staff eats for free, which is really good for us, and overall its just a good deal because Dylan makes money and we eat for free. I offered to redesign Dylan's sign, so Gerry saw me drawing at reception. The next day he was talking to Gabi, and he was like "she's just drawing all the time, if she hates working so much she can leave anytime" and its like. Say it to my face. If you're such a big guy. You know? He always talks behind people's backs. Even Laurence, who is probably his favourite. Like Laurence knows he talks shit behind her back.
                <br>
                - When Laurence got back the second time from Germany, Gerry was like "how was Germany, did you get railed a lot". Laurence went "fuck you" and walked away. That's the whole story.
                <br><br>
                I think that mostly covers the updates so far. I hope I've convinced you of how awful Gerry is. This is definitely not everything, but it's all the notes that I can think of right now. Let me know your thoughts!

        <h2>July 12</h2>
        <div>
            <p>
                I cried today. I had to call my sister (thanks Kortney) to feel better. I know yesterday I said I had a list of things to 
                talk about, but I think that this incident takes precedent, at least right now. I think that I had noticed something simmering under the surface for a little while now, and today it just really took ahold of me. 
                <br><br>
                I think that being the only POC here is really stressing me out. It's a lot of little things, I mentioned in the last entry Taylor being one of them (although hers is completely harmless and I still think very highly of her). But its getting called a slur in the street yesterday, and then people at the hostel asking whether I'm from China and things 
                like that. I also don't have anyone to really talk about it with. Maybe Aby would understand becuase she lived in Chicago, but she's like white and blonde, but for example, Gabi is painfully European, and Jess (who was POC, but not in a way that is as visible as me) is gone. I think things came to a head today when Gerry said something racist against Indian people and I called him out. And Laurence 
                was sitting next to me and kid of just went on her phone while I had a full on argument with Gerry. And this isn't the first time I 
                have outright called Gerry racist. He said something racist against South Americans a while back and I said it to him point blank that 
                it was a racist thign to say. And I thinnk the reason I got so caught up in this argument is because of how stressed I had been because 
                of my race. And this is something that I had fully anticipated when I decided to come to Italy. I know that Italians can be racist 
                against South East Asians. But I thought that at least the hostel would be safe. 
                <br><br>
                Now I'm thinking whether or not I should have confronted Gerry like that. I think about Laurence who decided to stay out of it, and 
                Laurence is clever like that, she is very good at keeping the peace with things. But I also think that she had less of a personal stake 
                in this argument than I did. And I also don't know whether I should have just kept my mouth shut, because why should I argue with some 
                old man who is never going to change if it stresses me out as much as it does. I cried after the argument. Gerry said that he noticed 
                that I was "very opinionated" and had a "lot of weird opinions", and I don't know. I know that this is a classic way that people attack 
                women, but those two things really struck a chord with me, and it's what is ringing in my head right now (this happened about a hour 
                ago). He also said like "if you don't like it, you can leave", not in a serious way, like I don't for a second think that he is 
                threatening to kick me out, but I responded like "I am so aware that I can leave" and I feel like I got caught up in that. 
                <br><br>
                I think I'm so stressed also becuase this is a pattern for me, where I don't know when to stop with a lot of these arguments where I 
                am overly invested and I end up getting hurt for standing up for myself. I think I need to learn when to stop, and I'm scared that 
                Laurence was judging me for not knowing. However, I am also considering an angle where I am upset at Laurence for not defending me. She 
                was sitting right next to me. It could have been 2 against 1 and my burden could have been considerably lightened. But she decided to 
                stay out of it and I don't know whether I am right to resent her for it. 
                <br><br>
                Gerry offered my weed after, not because I think he was trying to smooth things over, but becuase I think he genuinely does not feel 
                impacted by these conversations whatsoever. I didn't cry in front of him and I kept everything composed, and I even went up to him 10 
                minutes later to ask about some stuff for the morning shift tomorrow. I don't think I showed anythig in front of him, so that is a win 
                for sure. 
                <br><br>
                I don't really know who to talk to about this at the hostel. Things about race in general. Back home in Toronto, I feel like even 
                people who aren't POC are sensitive to these topics and understand why my experiences are valid and concerning. But here, like 
                these people just don't get it. I think this is just gonna be something I'll have to deal with. 
                <br><br>
                I will continue with my list of updates later, but I think that this was someting extremely pressing that happened today, so I hope a 
                few of you have some advice or something on how to go on here. Talk to you later!

        <div>
            <p>
                I realize I haven't updated in an extremely long time, but I just haven't had the time! Or when I do, I just try to rest. 
                The work isn't demanding but I don't put enough effort into making time for things. I'll try to cover the major updates and 
                then do a little reflection.
                <br><br>
                First of all, I think that I will do a breakdown of the other workers now that I have had some time to get to know them:
                <br><br>
                - Gabi is so lovely. She is young, but she is so bubbly and kind. Extremely easy to talk to, and definitely the person that 
                I'm the most comfortable talking to. I spend most of my time with her, and she's just so great. 
                <br>
                - Jess is amazing! One of my favourite people for sure, but she left yesterday, very sadly. Maybe it's becuase she's much older 
                but I feel like she understood a lot of things about me very quickly. I asked her whether or not she thought I would end up 
                staying the full time (apparently a lot of people don't, a lot of people quit early) and she said no.
                <br>
                - I like Laurence a lot, but sometimes I think she doesn't like me. Maybe I just have trouble knowing how to talk to her, but 
                idk I get that sense sometimes. Me, her and Gabi went to Sorrento yesterday as a day trip, and I got the sense that she was a 
                bit irritable all day. I think it was because Jess was leaving and Laurence and Jess are quite close, but it's hard to not take 
                it personally.
                <br>
                - Aby and Taylor are great. Aby is super cool, and we get along. It's hard to get a read on her, but I have definitely never 
                thought that she doesn't like me like with Laurence. She's just a sweet girl all around. She was pretty sad this week becuase 
                there was a situation with a guy back home over SNAPCHAT of all things, where he kind of led her on while he still had a 
                girlfriend. She cried a lot this week.
                <br>
                - Taylor is also lovely, an excellent coversationalist. She's going to school in speech pathology or something like that working 
                with kids, and you can really tell, she is just great at making people feel welcome talking to her. Sometimes, I get the sense 
                that she doesn't really have many POC friends back home in rural Wisconsin (I think at least Aby went to college in Chicago, so 
                I don't get that sense as much). She seems kind of shy when asking about certain things, like I have a soju bottle sticker on my 
                water bottle and she didn't know what it was. Which is fine, I just assumed they don't really have it in rural Wisconsin, but she 
                seemed apologetic for not knowing, even though it's not a big deal and very understandable. I occasionally get the sense that she  
                is walking on eggshells around me. Maybe it's all in my head, but if it's true I think it does kind of create a distance. Taylor 
                was also sad this week, because of an INCIDENT, that I will get into below. She was so stressed that she kind of snapped at me and 
                Gabi while she was working, but I don't think it was personal since it was at both of us.
                <br>
                - There's a new guy who showed up! His name is Leo but all of us call him Dylan. His full first name is like Dylan Leo, but he got 
                put on the schedule and everything as Dylan, and we were referring to him as Dylan for like a week before he arrived. And when he 
                showed up he said he introduced himself as Leo, but oh my god. He is such a Dylan. Like he acts like a Dylan. He said only his Mom 
                calls him Dylan when she's mad. Jess said he wasn't gonna last the full 6 weeks (which is what prompted my question from 
                earlier). I kind of agree. We think he was hired because Agostino wanted a guy buddy, because on the reception computer we 
                have access to all the volunteers applications and his was not partiularly compelling. However, most of the demographic interested 
                in this kind of work is women, because I guess men don't wanna do housekeeping/reception. Dylan/Leo is alright though so far. I don't 
                think I've had the chance to connect with him yet, but he seems like a nice enough guy. He's really eager to conntribute which is a 
                good sign, but Jess is a bit skeptical. I don't think he's really cut out for the job though. He's definitely not like out of shape 
                per se, but I think he's having trouble with the heat and like the kind of housework style activities that we do. For example today, 
                he was really struggling in the heat, and he was sweating so so much, just from the morning shift. The morning shift is not very 
                physically taxing, because although you have to change beds and sweep and stuff, you stay on the 1st floor, which is the coolest 
                because of heat rising, but also running up and down the stairs is really exhausting. Middle shift, which takes place in the hottest 
                part of the day, is changing beds and sweeping on the 2nd and 3rd floors, which Dylan/Leo is doing tomorrow. I think he has a lot of 
                grit though, so I think he will do well.
                <br><br>
                THE INCIDENT: 
                <br><br>
                SO there was an incident that happened a couple of days ago that made 2 of the girls cry. Basically, one complaint that people have is 
                that it's not always clear what tasks you have to do. For example, in the morning you put out breakfast, sweep and mop the first floor,
                do check-outs, etc... However, sometimes the owners will just spring a new task on you, which I guess is theoretically fine, if you are 
                done the ones that are expected of you, but the way that they say it is really rude and disrespectful. Like if they see you sitting on 
                your phone at reception (which is like, someone has to stay at reception in case someone checks out) and you're done all your tasks, 
                they'll come up to you and be like "I can't beleive you didn't check for spiderwebs on the third floor" or something, and then get mad 
                at you for being on your phone. And it just doesn't make sense, because it's not like "check spiderwebs" is a task on the list of things 
                to do, they just saw a spiderweb, and wanted it cleaned. Which is FINE because they are the owners, but don't make us feel bad for not 
                checking when it's not layed out in the epxectations. Just politely ask if we could get rid of the spiderweb on the third floor and we 
                will pretty happily do it. And also, all the tasks just need to be finished before our shift is over, so 
                for example, if we're ahead of schedule, we can take a break and make lunch or breakfast or something (as long as someone is sitting at 
                reception) before getting started sweeping. Basically, Jess was training me, and because it was essentially 2 people doing 1 person's 
                job, we finished everything really quickly, so we just sat there kind of chatting. Not only that, Agostino was visitng the property so 
                he was sitting at reception, so we really didn't have anything to do. Then all of a sudden, Agostino goes up to Jess and is like "I've 
                been here for an hour and a half and you haven't done anything, I can't believe you're teaching the new girl to be lazy (me)" and she was 
                like, we've finished all our tasks! And you were sitting at reception, we physically could not be there becuase you were like in the 
                chair. And he was like "You think there's nothing to do? I'll show you all the things you could do", and he made Jess follow him around 
                the hostel and he would just point out things like "that is dirty, that is dirty" really aggressively, and he was pointing out 
                like random things like the dust on the radiator or dirt on the stairs (cleaning the stairs is extra not our job because the cleaning lady 
                does the stairs). And Jess is 33, she knows how to stand up for herself. And she was like "Do not accuse me of teaching her to be lazy, 
                I know my job, I have been working here for over 2 months". It got to the point where they started screaming at each other upstairs and 
                I was downstairs checking in a guest, and while I was showing the guest the room, me and the guest walked past Agostino screaming at Jess 
                and he didn't even pause, which is SUPER unprofessional. Because the guest started asking me what was happening and I had to be like haha 
                I'm sure it's nothing, because I wouldn't want to stay at a hostel where the staff are yelling at each other! And becuase of how the hostel 
                is shaped, with a courtyard in the middle, you can hear people screaming really well, and the sound echoes like crazy. Then, after that, 
                Taylor was working a shift at the same time, and he went to her and was like why haven't you swept the common room? And she was like, I 
                have an hour left in my shift, I was gonna do it later and Agostino was like "don't lie and say you were gonna do it later, if you 
                haven't done it now, you were never gonna do it" and Taylor was just very shocked by that, and rightfully so! And Taylor tried to defend 
                herself, and he kept just being mean, and it ended with Jess and Taylor both crying. We concluded that he must have just been having a 
                bad day or something, but there is also another theory which I will explain later. I've concluded that if he ever talks to me that way I 
                will get on a flight and leave. So maybe Jess is right. 
                <br><br>
                GABI 2: 
                <br><br>
                The other day, I met Gabi (different Gabi). She is an old worker at the hostel, and she and Jess are good friends, since she is also 
                Brazilian. She was just stopping by for a day, visiting Jess, but while she was here, she told me the whole story with Clara and 
                Agostino. For ease of understanding, she will be referred to as Gabi 2. So Clara and Gabi 2 were good friends and they worked here 
                together last summer. Something I also didn't know is that Clara is 23, so she's a lot younger than I thought. Clara indeed had a boyfriend 
                for 7 years who she broke up with over text while she was in Naples. According to Gabi 2, Agostino has a good friend who works at the 
                hostel occasionally, like a proper paid worker who usually comes to Naples in the summer. While his friend is in Naples, he lives with 
                Agostino. And apparently in Septemberish of last year, Clara started dating the friend! Clara worked here for almost a year by the way. So 
                while the friend was living in Agostino's house, Clara was dating the friend. Then, next thing Gabi 2 knows, when she visits in February, 
                Clara is dating Agostino. Clara and Gabi 2 had had a falling out at this point over the situation. And Gerry indeed kicked her out of 
                the hostel, after her having worked there for almost a year. So Clara is still in Naples, and apparently she works as an English/Spanish 
                teacher, and someone also told me nanny? 
                <br>
                So another thing I found out from Gabi 2, is that before Greta, Gerry was dating a girl named Lucille, who was ALSO 19!! So this is a 
                pattern for Gerry. Apparently Lucille looked a lot like Greta. I also found out that Greta was not very nice to Jess which is upsetting 
                to hear. Gabi 2 really judged Gerry for kicking Clara out for doing exactly the same thing he was doing. There is another girl who used 
                to work here, Gloria, who Jess is also still friends with, and Gloria actually visited Greta and Gerry while they were in Genoa, and 
                Glora told Jess "don't trust Gerry or anythig he says" because apparently Gerry talked shit (?) said vile and extremely out of pocket things 
                about every single one of the girls behind their back while he was there. Around other of his employees! Unprofessional doesn't even 
                begin to describe this situation. Jess said that once she leaves, then Gloria might feel more free to tell her what exactly happened, 
                since apparently Gloria is very guarded as a person and doesn't want to start trouble. Jess will keep us updated. 
                <br><br>
                Ok I have way more notes on things i want to talk about, but it is almost 4am and I am getting sleepy, but I promise I have notes on 
                stories I want to cover, and they are good. Stay tuned and talk to you soon!

            Hi! Late update today because I had the night shift, so I didn't really get that much time to sit down and write stuff. I'll try to 
            get back on track with the crossword tomorrow, and the connections and everything. I went 
            to the beach with Gabi as expected, and it was great! The UV was like 9 today so I got so so tan, noticeably so. When I got back 
            I was so hot that I decided that shirt and pants are not for me anymore and that this summer I will become a dress person. I've 
            decided that I am having an "Everything is romantic - by Charli xcx" summer (just listen to it). So a couple of the characters I've 
            encountered so far at the hostel (guests):
            <br><br>
            - There is this Danish guy who is kind of getting on my nerves. He keeps finding excuses to talk to the staff at reception, like the 
            most stupid stuff, not even important stuff. He asked us if there were any other Danish people staying at the hostel and we had to be 
            like no I don't think we can tell you that sort of thing. He also got his phone stolen yesterday which I thought was funny. He also 
            brought his tattoo machine and offered to tattoo the girls so I might just get a tattoo tomorrow lol.<br>
            - There is a Croatian girl who needs her sheets changed every single day. We were like, this is a hostel, we don't do that, but she 
            was like no it's okay, I can go pay to get them washed myself at a laundromat, so it was fine I guess. BUT the lore for the day is that 
            she found me at reception and was like oh can you open the laundry room for me, I have to wash my dress. And I was like no sorry the 
            laundry room is just for staff to wash towels and stuff, like it's not for guests. And she said no Gerry told me that it would be okay 
            for me to use it. And I was like ??? because it's like not a thing that the guests are allowed to use it. Turns out that Gerry was 
            definitely hitting on her, and as we were closing up I saw Gerry be like oh where are you guys going? And her and her friend told him 
            about the bar they were going to go to, and he was like oh that's right by where I live, and they all left together. Therefore, Gerry is 
            a dog, espeically after the Greta thing. Also Jess told me that Gerry still calls Greta, as recently as this week.<br>
            - There was this sketchy guy who showed up at the hostel, Jess thinks that he was selling drugs. He booked really last minute and 
            he had a really big bandage on his arm, except it looked weird. The texture was like those plastic things they wrap fruit in at the 
            supermarket, except it was on his entire arm, and there was also some clear plastic wrap and like really not well put together bandages. 
            <br>
            - I met this Dutch guy who is the CEO of this mouse trap company. Like he designs and builds mousetraps for biologists to catch specimens 
            for research. He talked for ages about how he designed them and apparently he's in Italy for the Italian Congress for Mammals or something 
            like that. Really fascinating guy. 
            <br><br>
            I met Jess! And she's great and she knows so much gossip. So apparently she's really annoyed that Gerry seems to show a lot of favouritism 
            with the different staff. Like, he gets into weird moods all the time and he will yell at people for one thing and be fine with other 
            people for other things. Also Jess is way less of a character than I thought. Like, she is really sweet, and she was really kind and 
            understanding with me. She talks about her exes a lot, and she's just so great. So sad that she's leaving next week. 
            <br><br>
            That's all I can think of for now! Tomorrow I think I will go shopping for more dresses. Mood is high and the sun is shining.
            <br><br>

            Hello! So this is the first day of me actually working at the hostel, and it was great! I just made some beds and swept, then did 
            reception. Aby was training me and it was fun! I got to talk to her a lot. She looks and sounds exactly like Sarah (Manning House), 
            but from Wisconsin I guess. That was most of my day.
            <br> <br>
            Then, I went grocery shopping, and I super embarassingly only brought a 5 euro note because I'm an idiot, and as I went up to pay, I 
            realized and I was like omg. But it ended up being like 6 euros! So I just gave back the butter and nothing dramatic happened. I got 
            a thing of spaghetti, a piece of ciabatta, a container of cherry tomatoes and a bell pepper! All for under 5 euros! During my shift I 
            also chatted with Gerry more. So there is like hostel tea. Gerry is a 45 year old man, but apparently there was a girl who used to 
            work here, Greta, and she and Gerry had a thing. Greta was 19! And apparently they went to Genoa together after she finished her work. 
            And he hates the two American girls, Aby and Taylor, for no reason! He is from Seattle so it makes no sense because he is also American. 
            Anyways, that is the history I found out. ALSO, there is a girl named Clara, and she was in a relationship for 7 years, then she 
            started working here and she started dating Agostino, the other owner, and Gerry kicked her out, because of it, and so she moved in 
            with Agostino and she's still living in Naples. My question is, Gerry is such a hypocrite? Also how did Agostino feel about all this, since 
            he is also an owner?? Lots of mystery to solve. Anyways, there is so much lore. 
            <br> <br>
            They moved me into a private room today, with Gabi, which is nice becuase I like Gabi (I like everyone honestly so far). There was a 
            blackout today for like 3 hours in the evening. Me and the girls went to this bar that they call Mario's becuase it's owned by a guy 
            named Mario, which is funny. It was so nice being in Naples in the evening and getting to experience everything.
            <br> <br>
            ALSO one of the guests that I was chit chatting with today went to Oxford! She did her Master's in gender studies and she just finished. 
            She was talking to me about how much she disliked it. And I was like oof. She was nice to talk to though. I made a nice pasta for dinnner 
            even though I kind of burnt the garlic. Overall, I think I had a really great day. I like everyone so far, and there are no real 
            complaints right now. I'm halfway done Normal People. I didn't expect so much of the dialogue in the show to be taken right from the books!
            Tomorrow I have plans to go to the beach with Gabi, and maybe do some shopping. Theres a flea market here where all the clothes are 1 euro, 
            and so a lot of the girls here do a lot of shopping, and I am excited! Because I brought very very few clothes, since I only brought a 35L. 
            Also Gabi tried to teach me some Lithuanian today. It is so hard! She was telling me about how nouns have different conjugation based on what 
            kind of noun they are, like "house" will be a different word based on whether it's house as a location like "i am going home" versus house as 
            an item, like "i am selling my house". She was so invested in teaching me as well.
            <br> <br>
            I think I felt a lot less anxiety today with coming here on such a whim. I think talking to the girls all day, and with the guests brought 
            me a lot of peace. I like having a plan for the day and knowing what's going on. I also think that I know the hostel a lot better now so I 
            can actually relax truly. I still miss a lot of people at home but I feel a lot more secure than I did yesterday. Also, now that I know the 
            actual work tasks, it is a lot less daunting. Tomorrow, I have the night shift with Jess, who I just met an hour ago, so I'm excited to have 
            another person to meet.

            Truly cannot believe that the entry below is the last entry from one day ago, because so much has happened since then. SO first of
            all, almost right after having written the entry below, I ALMOST MISSED MY FLIGHT. And I DO NOT BLAME MYSELF. So I left the cafe below
            at 1:30PM for a 5:20PM flight. Right? So then I take the subway to where the coach goes from the main rail station London to London Luton 
            Airport, which is one of those like worse kind of airports for low-budget airlines (RyanAir woop woop). I am so prepared. I bought the 
            coach ticket the day before and I timed it so that I should get to the airport at around 3-3:20PM which should be fine London to Naples.
            <br> <br>
            I get to the main train station at  1:50PM, for a 2PM coach, because I am so prepared. The first coach GOES RIGHT BY ME. Becuase I didn't 
            think I had to flag down a SHUTTLE BUS. Anyways, I wait for the next bus, which is supposed to arrive at 2:15. I get on it, but my ticket 
            doesn't work becuase it's for a different bus company. The guy says the next one should be coming at 2:30 for my bus company. I'm like okay, 
            and at this point I'm a bit antsy. I finally see my bus arrive, and I flag it down. IT ALMOST GOES BY ME but I wave my arms crazily and the 
            guy is like okay and pulls over. So now I'm on the bus, and I'm panicking a bit becuase it's a 1h30 to 1h50 minute ride, and the gates close 
            at 4:50PM. the bus takes 2 HOURS to get there because of the traffic, and at this point it's 4:30 and the gates close in 20 minutes. AND I 
            HAVEN'T EVEN CHECKED IN. I run to the counter and the woman checks me in super fast. The security line is LONG. I beg the worker to let me 
            through quickly, and she lets me skip the line, she was like "Miss 15 minutes, what a troublemaker". I'm watching my bags go through security 
            and I'm like, if either of these gets pulled into the other lane, I'm not making my flight. Luckily both go through, and at exactly 4:50PM, 
            I make it to the gate (such a far gate btw). 
            <br> <br>
            And in my greatest time of need, as I am thirsty and so hungry since I had eaten nothing all day (i was gonna use the rest of my pounds at the 
            airport) I reach into my bag and pull out a smushed pain au chocolat, that I hadd bought the day before and forgot about. That's when I knew 
            that everything would be okay. 
            <br> <br>
            NAPLES! By the way, I took the taxi from the airport to the hotel (I googled the prices beforehand so I wouldn't get scammed, and many tried 
            to charge me like 50 euros), I was talking to this guy that I split the taxi with, and he was 17!!! I was shocked, like he was just solo travelling 
            during the summer between grade 11 and 12. Anyways.
            <br> <br>
            This hostel is beautiful! I met all the girls (all the volunteers are girls) and theres the two owners, Gerry and Agostino, who 
            are the owners. The first girl I met is Gabby, she is Lithuanian, and she is 19. Then there is Laurence, she is from Quebec City and she is 20. 
            There is Aby and Taylor, 2 friends from Wisconsin, and they are 22 and 23. There is also one other girl, Jess, that they keep saying is a 
            character. She is 30 something Brazilian, and I haven't  met  her yet, but I'm excited! I love characters. On the other hand, Gerry is a 
            really big character. He's this American guy from Washington and he is just so brash and knows a ton about astrology. I was talking to Laurence 
            about her compatibility as a Virgo, and Gerry walked by and he literally knew all the compatible signs with Virgo. Apparently he went to art school 
            and he's an artist. Agostino is the guy who showed me around and he's this French guy. He kind of walks like, you know how a pitbull walks around 
            knowing that it's big? But he's my height. Anwyays, I don't want to make any judgemennts on anyone yet in case they end up being sus, but yeah! 
            Everyone seems really lovely so far, and I'm excited!
            <br><br>
            I didn't do much on the first day. I woke up, found Gabby and introduced myself, took a nap, went on this long walk where I forgot my water, 
            got a kebab with Laurence, started reading Normal People, since it was one of the books that was just lying around (the book goes a lot faster 
            than the show, I'm already at where Connell initially meets Marianne at Trinity), took another nap, then went to dinner with all of the girls 
            (except Jess). We got pizza at this great place, and I got to know them better. I tried melonchello for the first time. It's like lemoncello but 
            it tastes like a melona bar.
            <br><br>
            Anyways, long update for today, bye bye for now!

        I leave for Naples today! I'm sitting in a cafe right now, killig time until my 5pm flight. I guess it's not killing time, because I am
        really enjoying working on this website actually. Plus I did the crossword. I am going to be doing a work exchange at a hostel in Naples
        for 6 weeks (hopefully). I'm really nervous but I also think that it's such an awesome opportunity that I can't say no to. I decided to 
        do this like 2 days ago. This is good because I'll be saving a ton of money. 
        <br><br>
        I spent the last 2 weeks in the UK and I thought that it was a lovely experience! London is great, I understand why Taylor Swift liked it 
        so much. I also don't know why people (my PI) was hyping up to me how much a culture shock it would be. Everyone is really nice (a girl
        complimented my hair on the street yesterday) and the weather isn't even that bad (although I've been told that I came at a really 
        advantageous time). Edinburgh was also lovely, but the guy I talked to in the Glasgow phone store was right, there's way too many tourists.
        I don't mind acting like a tourist when I am one, but it was more a complaint about the sheer number of people that were there. Either way,
        I can't wait to finally spend time on an actual beach. 
        <br><br>
        Anyways, despite how yappy I feel right now, I don't want to write too much for the first entry because that's setting the bar too high 
        for the content I will be expecting out of myself.
