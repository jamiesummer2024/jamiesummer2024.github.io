        <div>
            <p>
                I realize I haven't updated in an extremely long time, but I just haven't had the time! Or when I do, I just try to rest. 
                The work isn't demanding but I don't put enough effort into making time for things. I'll try to cover the major updates and 
                then do a little reflection.
                <br><br>
                First of all, I think that I will do a breakdown of the other workers now that I have had some time to get to know them:
                <br><br>
                - Gabi is so lovely. She is young, but she is so bubbly and kind. Extremely easy to talk to, and definitely the person that 
                I'm the most comfortable talking to. I spend most of my time with her, and she's just so great. 
                <br>
                - Jess is amazing! One of my favourite people for sure, but she left yesterday, very sadly. Maybe it's becuase she's much older 
                but I feel like she understood a lot of things about me very quickly. I asked her whether or not she thought I would end up 
                staying the full time (apparently a lot of people don't, a lot of people quit early) and she said no.
                <br>
                - I like Laurence a lot, but sometimes I think she doesn't like me. Maybe I just have trouble knowing how to talk to her, but 
                idk I get that sense sometimes. Me, her and Gabi went to Sorrento yesterday as a day trip, and I got the sense that she was a 
                bit irritable all day. I think it was because Jess was leaving and Laurence and Jess are quite close, but it's hard to not take 
                it personally.
                <br>
                - Aby and Taylor are great. Aby is super cool, and we get along. It's hard to get a read on her, but I have definitely never 
                thought that she doesn't like me like with Laurence. She's just a sweet girl all around. She was pretty sad this week becuase 
                there was a situation with a guy back home over SNAPCHAT of all things, where he kind of led her on while he still had a 
                girlfriend. She cried a lot this week.
                <br>
                - Taylor is also lovely, an excellent coversationalist. She's going to school in speech pathology or something like that working 
                with kids, and you can really tell, she is just great at making people feel welcome talking to her. Sometimes, I get the sense 
                that she doesn't really have many POC friends back home in rural Wisconsin (I think at least Aby went to college in Chicago, so 
                I don't get that sense as much). She seems kind of shy when asking about certain things, like I have a soju bottle sticker on my 
                water bottle and she didn't know what it was. Which is fine, I just assumed they don't really have it in rural Wisconsin, but she 
                seemed apologetic for not knowing, even though it's not a big deal and very understandable. I occasionally get the sense that she  
                is walking on eggshells around me. Maybe it's all in my head, but if it's true I think it does kind of create a distance. Taylor 
                was also sad this week, because of an INCIDENT, that I will get into below. She was so stressed that she kind of snapped at me and 
                Gabi while she was working, but I don't think it was personal since it was at both of us.
                <br>
                - There's a new guy who showed up! His name is Leo but all of us call him Dylan. His full first name is like Dylan Leo, but he got 
                put on the schedule and everything as Dylan, and we were referring to him as Dylan for like a week before he arrived. And when he 
                showed up he said he introduced himself as Leo, but oh my god. He is such a Dylan. Like he acts like a Dylan. He said only his Mom 
                calls him Dylan when she's mad. Jess said he wasn't gonna last the full 6 weeks (which is what prompted my question from 
                earlier). I kind of agree. We think he was hired because Agostino wanted a guy buddy, because on the reception computer we 
                have access to all the volunteers applications and his was not partiularly compelling. However, most of the demographic interested 
                in this kind of work is women, because I guess men don't wanna do housekeeping/reception. Dylan/Leo is alright though so far. I don't 
                think I've had the chance to connect with him yet, but he seems like a nice enough guy. He's really eager to conntribute which is a 
                good sign, but Jess is a bit skeptical. I don't think he's really cut out for the job though. He's definitely not like out of shape 
                per se, but I think he's having trouble with the heat and like the kind of housework style activities that we do. For example today, 
                he was really struggling in the heat, and he was sweating so so much, just from the morning shift. The morning shift is not very 
                physically taxing, because although you have to change beds and sweep and stuff, you stay on the 1st floor, which is the coolest 
                because of heat rising, but also running up and down the stairs is really exhausting. Middle shift, which takes place in the hottest 
                part of the day, is changing beds and sweeping on the 2nd and 3rd floors, which Dylan/Leo is doing tomorrow. I think he has a lot of 
                grit though, so I think he will do well.
                <br><br>
                THE INCIDENT: 
                <br><br>
                SO there was an incident that happened a couple of days ago that made 2 of the girls cry. Basically, one complaint that people have is 
                that it's not always clear what tasks you have to do. For example, in the morning you put out breakfast, sweep and mop the first floor,
                do check-outs, etc... However, sometimes the owners will just spring a new task on you, which I guess is theoretically fine, if you are 
                done the ones that are expected of you, but the way that they say it is really rude and disrespectful. Like if they see you sitting on 
                your phone at reception (which is like, someone has to stay at reception in case someone checks out) and you're done all your tasks, 
                they'll come up to you and be like "I can't beleive you didn't check for spiderwebs on the third floor" or something, and then get mad 
                at you for being on your phone. And it just doesn't make sense, because it's not like "check spiderwebs" is a task on the list of things 
                to do, they just saw a spiderweb, and wanted it cleaned. Which is FINE because they are the owners, but don't make us feel bad for not 
                checking when it's not layed out in the epxectations. Just politely ask if we could get rid of the spiderweb on the third floor and we 
                will pretty happily do it. And also, all the tasks just need to be finished before our shift is over, so 
                for example, if we're ahead of schedule, we can take a break and make lunch or breakfast or something (as long as someone is sitting at 
                reception) before getting started sweeping. Basically, Jess was training me, and because it was essentially 2 people doing 1 person's 
                job, we finished everything really quickly, so we just sat there kind of chatting. Not only that, Agostino was visitng the property so 
                he was sitting at reception, so we really didn't have anything to do. Then all of a sudden, Agostino goes up to Jess and is like "I've 
                been here for an hour and a half and you haven't done anything, I can't believe you're teaching the new girl to be lazy (me)" and she was 
                like, we've finished all our tasks! And you were sitting at reception, we physically could not be there becuase you were like in the 
                chair. And he was like "You think there's nothing to do? I'll show you all the things you could do", and he made Jess follow him around 
                the hostel and he would just point out things like "that is dirty, that is dirty" really aggressively, and he was pointing out 
                like random things like the dust on the radiator or dirt on the stairs (cleaning the stairs is extra not our job because the cleaning lady 
                does the stairs). And Jess is 33, she knows how to stand up for herself. And she was like "Do not accuse me of teaching her to be lazy, 
                I know my job, I have been working here for over 2 months". It got to the point where they started screaming at each other upstairs and 
                I was downstairs checking in a guest, and while I was showing the guest the room, me and the guest walked past Agostino screaming at Jess 
                and he didn't even pause, which is SUPER unprofessional. Because the guest started asking me what was happening and I had to be like haha 
                I'm sure it's nothing, because I wouldn't want to stay at a hostel where the staff are yelling at each other! And becuase of how the hostel 
                is shaped, with a courtyard in the middle, you can hear people screaming really well, and the sound echoes like crazy. Then, after that, 
                Taylor was working a shift at the same time, and he went to her and was like why haven't you swept the common room? And she was like, I 
                have an hour left in my shift, I was gonna do it later and Agostino was like "don't lie and say you were gonna do it later, if you 
                haven't done it now, you were never gonna do it" and Taylor was just very shocked by that, and rightfully so! And Taylor tried to defend 
                herself, and he kept just being mean, and it ended with Jess and Taylor both crying. We concluded that he must have just been having a 
                bad day or something, but there is also another theory which I will explain later. I've concluded that if he ever talks to me that way I 
                will get on a flight and leave. So maybe Jess is right. 
                <br><br>
                GABI 2: 
                <br><br>
                The other day, I met Gabi (different Gabi). She is an old worker at the hostel, and she and Jess are good friends, since she is also 
                Brazilian. She was just stopping by for a day, visiting Jess, but while she was here, she told me the whole story with Clara and 
                Agostino. For ease of understanding, she will be referred to as Gabi 2. So Clara and Gabi 2 were good friends and they worked here 
                together last summer. Something I also didn't know is that Clara is 23, so she's a lot younger than I thought. Clara indeed had a boyfriend 
                for 7 years who she broke up with over text while she was in Naples. According to Gabi 2, Agostino has a good friend who works at the 
                hostel occasionally, like a proper paid worker who usually comes to Naples in the summer. While his friend is in Naples, he lives with 
                Agostino. And apparently in Septemberish of last year, Clara started dating the friend! Clara worked here for almost a year by the way. So 
                while the friend was living in Agostino's house, Clara was dating the friend. Then, next thing Gabi 2 knows, when she visits in February, 
                Clara is dating Agostino. Clara and Gabi 2 had had a falling out at this point over the situation. And Gerry indeed kicked her out of 
                the hostel, after her having worked there for almost a year. So Clara is still in Naples, and apparently she works as an English/Spanish 
                teacher, and someone also told me nanny? 
                <br>
                So another thing I found out from Gabi 2, is that before Greta, Gerry was dating a girl named Lucille, who was ALSO 19!! So this is a 
                pattern for Gerry. Apparently Lucille looked a lot like Greta. I also found out that Greta was not very nice to Jess which is upsetting 
                to hear. Gabi 2 really judged Gerry for kicking Clara out for doing exactly the same thing he was doing. There is another girl who used 
                to work here, Gloria, who Jess is also still friends with, and Gloria actually visited Greta and Gerry while they were in Genoa, and 
                Glora told Jess "don't trust Gerry or anythig he says" because apparently Gerry talked shit (?) said vile and extremely out of pocket things 
                about every single one of the girls behind their back while he was there. Around other of his employees! Unprofessional doesn't even 
                begin to describe this situation. Jess said that once she leaves, then Gloria might feel more free to tell her what exactly happened, 
                since apparently Gloria is very guarded as a person and doesn't want to start trouble. Jess will keep us updated. 

                Ok I have way more notes on things i want to talk about, but it is almost 4am and I am getting sleepy, but I promise I have notes on 
                stories I want to cover, and they are good. Stay tuned and talk to you soon!

        <p>
            Hi! Late update today because I had the night shift, so I didn't really get that much time to sit down and write stuff. I'll try to 
            get back on track with the crossword tomorrow, and the connections and everything. I went 
            to the beach with Gabi as expected, and it was great! The UV was like 9 today so I got so so tan, noticeably so. When I got back 
            I was so hot that I decided that shirt and pants are not for me anymore and that this summer I will become a dress person. I've 
            decided that I am having an "Everything is romantic - by Charli xcx" summer (just listen to it). So a couple of the characters I've 
            encountered so far at the hostel (guests):
            <br><br>
            - There is this Danish guy who is kind of getting on my nerves. He keeps finding excuses to talk to the staff at reception, like the 
            most stupid stuff, not even important stuff. He asked us if there were any other Danish people staying at the hostel and we had to be 
            like no I don't think we can tell you that sort of thing. He also got his phone stolen yesterday which I thought was funny. He also 
            brought his tattoo machine and offered to tattoo the girls so I might just get a tattoo tomorrow lol.<br>
            - There is a Croatian girl who needs her sheets changed every single day. We were like, this is a hostel, we don't do that, but she 
            was like no it's okay, I can go pay to get them washed myself at a laundromat, so it was fine I guess. BUT the lore for the day is that 
            she found me at reception and was like oh can you open the laundry room for me, I have to wash my dress. And I was like no sorry the 
            laundry room is just for staff to wash towels and stuff, like it's not for guests. And she said no Gerry told me that it would be okay 
            for me to use it. And I was like ??? because it's like not a thing that the guests are allowed to use it. Turns out that Gerry was 
            definitely hitting on her, and as we were closing up I saw Gerry be like oh where are you guys going? And her and her friend told him 
            about the bar they were going to go to, and he was like oh that's right by where I live, and they all left together. Therefore, Gerry is 
            a dog, espeically after the Greta thing. Also Jess told me that Gerry still calls Greta, as recently as this week.<br>
            - There was this sketchy guy who showed up at the hostel, Jess thinks that he was selling drugs. He booked really last minute and 
            he had a really big bandage on his arm, except it looked weird. The texture was like those plastic things they wrap fruit in at the 
            supermarket, except it was on his entire arm, and there was also some clear plastic wrap and like really not well put together bandages. 
            <br>
            - I met this Dutch guy who is the CEO of this mouse trap company. Like he designs and builds mousetraps for biologists to catch specimens 
            for research. He talked for ages about how he designed them and apparently he's in Italy for the Italian Congress for Mammals or something 
            like that. Really fascinating guy. 
            <br><br>
            I met Jess! And she's great and she knows so much gossip. So apparently she's really annoyed that Gerry seems to show a lot of favouritism 
            with the different staff. Like, he gets into weird moods all the time and he will yell at people for one thing and be fine with other 
            people for other things. Also Jess is way less of a character than I thought. Like, she is really sweet, and she was really kind and 
            understanding with me. She talks about her exes a lot, and she's just so great. So sad that she's leaving next week. 
            <br><br>
            That's all I can think of for now! Tomorrow I think I will go shopping for more dresses. Mood is high and the sun is shining.

    <h2>July 4</h2>

        <p>
            Hello! So this is the first day of me actually working at the hostel, and it was great! I just made some beds and swept, then did 
            reception. Aby was training me and it was fun! I got to talk to her a lot. She looks and sounds exactly like Sarah (Manning House), 
            but from Wisconsin I guess. That was most of my day.
            <br> <br>
            Then, I went grocery shopping, and I super embarassingly only brought a 5 euro note because I'm an idiot, and as I went up to pay, I 
            realized and I was like omg. But it ended up being like 6 euros! So I just gave back the butter and nothing dramatic happened. I got 
            a thing of spaghetti, a piece of ciabatta, a container of cherry tomatoes and a bell pepper! All for under 5 euros! During my shift I 
            also chatted with Gerry more. So there is like hostel tea. Gerry is a 45 year old man, but apparently there was a girl who used to 
            work here, Greta, and she and Gerry had a thing. Greta was 19! And apparently they went to Genoa together after she finished her work. 
            And he hates the two American girls, Aby and Taylor, for no reason! He is from Seattle so it makes no sense because he is also American. 
            Anyways, that is the history I found out. ALSO, there is a girl named Clara, and she was in a relationship for 7 years, then she 
            started working here and she started dating Agostino, the other owner, and Gerry kicked her out, because of it, and so she moved in 
            with Agostino and she's still living in Naples. My question is, Gerry is such a hypocrite? Also how did Agostino feel about all this, since 
            he is also an owner?? Lots of mystery to solve. Anyways, there is so much lore. 
            <br> <br>
            They moved me into a private room today, with Gabi, which is nice becuase I like Gabi (I like everyone honestly so far). There was a 
            blackout today for like 3 hours in the evening. Me and the girls went to this bar that they call Mario's becuase it's owned by a guy 
            named Mario, which is funny. It was so nice being in Naples in the evening and getting to experience everything.
            <br> <br>
            ALSO one of the guests that I was chit chatting with today went to Oxford! She did her Master's in gender studies and she just finished. 
            She was talking to me about how much she disliked it. And I was like oof. She was nice to talk to though. I made a nice pasta for dinnner 
            even though I kind of burnt the garlic. Overall, I think I had a really great day. I like everyone so far, and there are no real 
            complaints right now. I'm halfway done Normal People. I didn't expect so much of the dialogue in the show to be taken right from the books!
            Tomorrow I have plans to go to the beach with Gabi, and maybe do some shopping. Theres a flea market here where all the clothes are 1 euro, 
            and so a lot of the girls here do a lot of shopping, and I am excited! Because I brought very very few clothes, since I only brought a 35L. 
            Also Gabi tried to teach me some Lithuanian today. It is so hard! She was telling me about how nouns have different conjugation based on what 
            kind of noun they are, like "house" will be a different word based on whether it's house as a location like "i am going home" versus house as 
            an item, like "i am selling my house". She was so invested in teaching me as well.
            <br> <br>
            I think I felt a lot less anxiety today with coming here on such a whim. I think talking to the girls all day, and with the guests brought 
            me a lot of peace. I like having a plan for the day and knowing what's going on. I also think that I know the hostel a lot better now so I 
            can actually relax truly. I still miss a lot of people at home but I feel a lot more secure than I did yesterday. Also, now that I know the 
            actual work tasks, it is a lot less daunting. Tomorrow, I have the night shift with Jess, who I just met an hour ago, so I'm excited to have 
            another person to meet.

            Truly cannot believe that the entry below is the last entry from one day ago, because so much has happened since then. SO first of
            all, almost right after having written the entry below, I ALMOST MISSED MY FLIGHT. And I DO NOT BLAME MYSELF. So I left the cafe below
            at 1:30PM for a 5:20PM flight. Right? So then I take the subway to where the coach goes from the main rail station London to London Luton 
            Airport, which is one of those like worse kind of airports for low-budget airlines (RyanAir woop woop). I am so prepared. I bought the 
            coach ticket the day before and I timed it so that I should get to the airport at around 3-3:20PM which should be fine London to Naples.
            <br> <br>
            I get to the main train station at  1:50PM, for a 2PM coach, because I am so prepared. The first coach GOES RIGHT BY ME. Becuase I didn't 
            think I had to flag down a SHUTTLE BUS. Anyways, I wait for the next bus, which is supposed to arrive at 2:15. I get on it, but my ticket 
            doesn't work becuase it's for a different bus company. The guy says the next one should be coming at 2:30 for my bus company. I'm like okay, 
            and at this point I'm a bit antsy. I finally see my bus arrive, and I flag it down. IT ALMOST GOES BY ME but I wave my arms crazily and the 
            guy is like okay and pulls over. So now I'm on the bus, and I'm panicking a bit becuase it's a 1h30 to 1h50 minute ride, and the gates close 
            at 4:50PM. the bus takes 2 HOURS to get there because of the traffic, and at this point it's 4:30 and the gates close in 20 minutes. AND I 
            HAVEN'T EVEN CHECKED IN. I run to the counter and the woman checks me in super fast. The security line is LONG. I beg the worker to let me 
            through quickly, and she lets me skip the line, she was like "Miss 15 minutes, what a troublemaker". I'm watching my bags go through security 
            and I'm like, if either of these gets pulled into the other lane, I'm not making my flight. Luckily both go through, and at exactly 4:50PM, 
            I make it to the gate (such a far gate btw). 
            <br> <br>
            And in my greatest time of need, as I am thirsty and so hungry since I had eaten nothing all day (i was gonna use the rest of my pounds at the 
            airport) I reach into my bag and pull out a smushed pain au chocolat, that I hadd bought the day before and forgot about. That's when I knew 
            that everything would be okay. 
            <br> <br>
            NAPLES! By the way, I took the taxi from the airport to the hotel (I googled the prices beforehand so I wouldn't get scammed, and many tried 
            to charge me like 50 euros), I was talking to this guy that I split the taxi with, and he was 17!!! I was shocked, like he was just solo travelling 
            during the summer between grade 11 and 12. Anyways.
            <br> <br>
            This hostel is beautiful! I met all the girls (all the volunteers are girls) and theres the two owners, Gerry and Agostino, who 
            are the owners. The first girl I met is Gabby, she is Lithuanian, and she is 19. Then there is Laurence, she is from Quebec City and she is 20. 
            There is Aby and Taylor, 2 friends from Wisconsin, and they are 22 and 23. There is also one other girl, Jess, that they keep saying is a 
            character. She is 30 something Brazilian, and I haven't  met  her yet, but I'm excited! I love characters. On the other hand, Gerry is a 
            really big character. He's this American guy from Washington and he is just so brash and knows a ton about astrology. I was talking to Laurence 
            about her compatibility as a Virgo, and Gerry walked by and he literally knew all the compatible signs with Virgo. Apparently he went to art school 
            and he's an artist. Agostino is the guy who showed me around and he's this French guy. He kind of walks like, you know how a pitbull walks around 
            knowing that it's big? But he's my height. Anwyays, I don't want to make any judgemennts on anyone yet in case they end up being sus, but yeah! 
            Everyone seems really lovely so far, and I'm excited!
            <br><br>
            I didn't do much on the first day. I woke up, found Gabby and introduced myself, took a nap, went on this long walk where I forgot my water, 
            got a kebab with Laurence, started reading Normal People, since it was one of the books that was just lying around (the book goes a lot faster 
            than the show, I'm already at where Connell initially meets Marianne at Trinity), took another nap, then went to dinner with all of the girls 
            (except Jess). We got pizza at this great place, and I got to know them better. I tried melonchello for the first time. It's like lemoncello but 
            it tastes like a melona bar.
            <br><br>
            Anyways, long update for today, bye bye for now!

        I leave for Naples today! I'm sitting in a cafe right now, killig time until my 5pm flight. I guess it's not killing time, because I am
        really enjoying working on this website actually. Plus I did the crossword. I am going to be doing a work exchange at a hostel in Naples
        for 6 weeks (hopefully). I'm really nervous but I also think that it's such an awesome opportunity that I can't say no to. I decided to 
        do this like 2 days ago. This is good because I'll be saving a ton of money. 
        <br><br>
        I spent the last 2 weeks in the UK and I thought that it was a lovely experience! London is great, I understand why Taylor Swift liked it 
        so much. I also don't know why people (my PI) was hyping up to me how much a culture shock it would be. Everyone is really nice (a girl
        complimented my hair on the street yesterday) and the weather isn't even that bad (although I've been told that I came at a really 
        advantageous time). Edinburgh was also lovely, but the guy I talked to in the Glasgow phone store was right, there's way too many tourists.
        I don't mind acting like a tourist when I am one, but it was more a complaint about the sheer number of people that were there. Either way,
        I can't wait to finally spend time on an actual beach. 
        <br><br>
        Anyways, despite how yappy I feel right now, I don't want to write too much for the first entry because that's setting the bar too high 
        for the content I will be expecting out of myself.
