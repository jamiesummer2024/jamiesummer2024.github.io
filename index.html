        <p>

            Hi guys! I have become weary of texting everyone the same updates all the time. Therefore, I'm going to dump all 
            my updates here because I can't stand it anymore. Because of this, I only want the people I would normally text 
            personally about these things to be able to see this. Please do not show this to other people or share the link around.
            Thank you! <br>
            <br>
            Also please ignore the fact that this is a reskinned version of my GGR472:Developing Web Maps final submission, which was 
            about the diversity of Birds in Yellowstone National Park (thank you Aidan). I know it's low key ugly right now, but I had 
            this idea like yesterday so be gently. However, I did feel kind of bad getting rid of all the birds, so if they might come 
            up sporadically. I will probably make it look nicer as time goes on.
            <br>
