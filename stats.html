                    I thought this Thursday was HARD. Maybe I'm too used to the NYT style, but the wapo felt weird today as well. I had 
                    so much trouble with the upper left corner. The theming was alright, I liked  "YO" but it seemed like a pretty basic 
                    theme for a Thursday, it feels like a missed opportunity for a stronger theme. 
                    I thought the connections today was cute for July 4th! Like liberty and fireworks and stuff. No notes.

                    Clever yet straightforward connection, it took embarassingly long for me to figure out the cake one but that's on me.
                    Light Wednesday, but the writing felt really weird, like the clue for "man" being "guy" felt kind of off. Also felt really 
                    smart being able to raw dog all the long answers, that helped a lot. The "moola" box was so fucked up and I've never heard of 
                    "mho". Also the theme was a bit bad sorry.

                    I liked the connections today, I thought the "quid" thing was a fun red herring. I'm rusty on the crossword because I haven't 
                    been doing it that consistently during my travels, but I thought the theme could have been stronger.
